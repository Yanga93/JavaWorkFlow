# JavaWorkFlow

### Assignment 1 - Eat Cupcake

In this assignment, you will practice using if statements and getting
input from a user in Java by writing a program based on a simple flow chart.

1 The Assignment - This assignment requires you to program the flow chart

Your program will ask a string of questions to help you figure out whether or
not you should eat a bit of food you dropped on the ground. The user will
supply answers, either YES. or NO., to these questions, until the program is
able to recommend a course of action.

1.1 Instructions
Write the class EatCupcake in the file EatCupcake.java. The main method
of the EatCupcake class should prompt the user to answer several yes or
no questions before printing a final string. All input and output should be
exactly as shown in the flow chart.

1.2 Tips
• Remember that your class name needs to be exactly the same as the
name of the file in which it is defined.
• Every string that is printed must end with a newline character.
• The System.out.println method automatically appends a newline
character to the string it prints.
• Make sure that all of your input and output exactly matches the strings
shown in the flow chart, including capitalization and punctuation.
